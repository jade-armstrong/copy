# Copy

This is a simple bash script that will copy a file from a git repository on your machine to another directory. This is useful if your project relies on a file from another repo.

Step 1: Download the script.

Step 2: Replace all variable values at the start of the script.

Step 3: Install the script from the folder you downloaded it to:
```bash
sudo install copy.sh ~bin/copy
```
Step 4: Run `copy` in the terminal whenever you want to run the script.
